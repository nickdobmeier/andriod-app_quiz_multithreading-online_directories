# andriod app - quiz with multithreading/online directories

User is prompted to enter name and then select if they want to take a quiz stored locally on the device or one on a webserver. Multithreading is required for fetching a quiz from a webserver. The user can then select a quiz from a list of quizzes, and then take the quiz. A quiz can be multiple questions, and at the end of the quiz, the user is shown their score, and returned to the main selection screen.

Additionally, if the user's input name is "professor", the user can modify exisiting quizzes already saved on the device, as well as add entirely new quizzes that are to be stored locally.
